- name: Price and Output Elasticities of Energy Demand for Industrial Sectors in OECD Countries

  summary: We use 274 industry panel data across 20 Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries from 1978 to 2013, to find the energy demand from energy-intensive industries to be less price elastic compared to the energy demand from industries that are less energy-intensive. Such finding could be attributed to these industries' higher dependency of the energy resource as well as the limited availability of substitutes that could replace energy when energy price increases/decreases.
